# Desktop-Notifications
This is a sample of a Desktop Notification with Javascript (Ajax XMLHttpRequests) and PHP.

You can choose to add more or modify the 'receive.php' file to add more Notifications.
Only works on an HTTPS server, so you can add it as a subdomain for modifications and inmprovements. The posts are added in the order;

     echo "Post Title (1)&&&Post Content(1)|||Post Title (2)&&&Post Content(2)|||Post Title (3)&&&Post Content(3)|||Post Title (4)&&&Post Content(4)"; and so on at the 'request.php' file.
